# create-repository

Easily set up a new github repository. Reads the name/description from the project.jenny file if it's present. Sets origin upstream if it's not already set.

```
npm install create-repository - g
```

## Usage

`create-repository` will try to read `project.jenny` and use the name and description properties.

```
$ create-repository
```

You can also pass values for name and description.

```
$ create-repository --name my-new-project --description "That's all I have to say about that"
```
